Description
Deep mutational scan of the RRM2 domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1). Data for single and double mutants only.
Abstract
This study measured the sequence-function relationships for variants in a common, eukaryotic RNA binding domain, the RRM2 domain of yeast Pab1. The results identified clusters of residues with similar mutational patterns as well as highly-conserved residues that are critical for stability and/or function.
Method
Variant reads were filtered such that all bases had at least Q20 for all positions. Log ratio scores were calculated using the Enrich software package and normalized to the wild type score.
