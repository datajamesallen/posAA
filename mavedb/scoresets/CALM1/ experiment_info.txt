Description
A Deep Mutational Scan of human Calmodulin using functional complementation in yeast via DMS-TileSeq.
Abstract
Although we now routinely sequence human genomes, we can confidently identify only a fraction of the sequence variants that have a functional impact. Here, we developed a deep mutational scanning framework that produces exhaustive maps for human missense variants by combining random codon mutagenesis and multiplexed functional variation assays with computational imputation and refinement. We applied this framework to four proteins corresponding to six human genes: UBE2I (encoding SUMO E2 conjugase), SUMO1 (small ubiquitin-like modifier), TPK1 (thiamin pyrophosphokinase), and CALM1/2/3 (three genes encoding the protein calmodulin). The resulting maps recapitulate known protein features and confidently identify pathogenic variation. Assays potentially amenable to deep mutational scanning are already available for 57% of human disease genes, suggesting that DMS could ultimately map functional variation for all human disease genes.

Method
##Scoring procedure:
DMS-TileSeq reads were processed using the [dmsPipeline](https://bitbucket.org/rothlabto/dmspipeline) software. Briefly, TileSeq read counts were used to establish relative allele frequencies in each condition. Non-mutagenized control counts were subtracted from counts (as estimates of sequencing error). log ratios of selection over non-selection counts were calculated. The resulting TileSeq fitness values were then normalized to 0-1 scale where 0 corresponds to the median nonsense score and 1 corresponds to the median synonymous score.
