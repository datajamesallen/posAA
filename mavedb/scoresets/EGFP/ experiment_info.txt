Description
Nucleotide scores for the start codon of EGFP and its effect on an N-terminal fusion.
Abstract
This is a dataset demonstrating the use of landing pad cell lines to generate recombinant mammalian cells. The experiment measured the effect of mutating the start codon of an EGFP construct with an N-terminal ubiquitin fusion. Once the ubiquitin is removed by cellular DUBs, the protein exposes a new N-terminal amino acid, which may target the protein for degradation.
Method
Read counts for each bin were converted into frequencies. Scores were calculated by multiplying the frequency in each of the four bins bin by the bin number (lowest abundance=1, highest abundance=4) and taking the sum. Scores for each of four replicates are reported individually, and the overall score is the mean of the four replicates.
