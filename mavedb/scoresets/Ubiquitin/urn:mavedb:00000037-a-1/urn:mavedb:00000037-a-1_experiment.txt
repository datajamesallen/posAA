Description
EMPIRIC amino acid scores for deep mutational scan of ubiquitin and its effect on yeast growth.
Abstract
This study performed a bulk growth competition experiment measuring the effect of point mutations on ubiquitin structure and function. The results were consistent with previous studies of individual mutants as well as Alanine-scanning. Positions were clustered by their tolerance of mutations and highly sensitive regions were mapped.
Method
Scores were calculated using EMPIRIC [Hietpas et al.]. Scores for each amino acid substitution are provided. The "Std" column lists the standard deviation calculated from multiple measurements of synonymous codons. This value is `nan` when only one codon was measured.

Variants that were severe loss of function or low plasmid count (and therefore not scored) were excluded from this dataset.
