Description
Amino acid scores for deep mutational scan of ubiquitin in a yeast display binding assay to E1 with limiting E1.
Abstract
This study measured the effect of single amino acid changes in ubiquitin on binding to E1 (Uba1). Combined with work from a previous study on the effect of ubiquitin mutations on yeast growth rate, this showed that ubiquitin-E1 binding was not linearly related to growth rate and that mutations in ubiquitin are likely to affect multiple function that modulate growth rate.

This experiment was performed in limiting E1 conditions (as opposed to excess E1).
Method
Scores were calculated using the EMPIRIC log ratios approach, using the ratio of E1-reactive cells to HA-displaying cells. Scores were normalized such that the average wild type synonymous variant was 1 and the average nonsense mutation was 0. The raw $log_2$ ratio is included as an extra column. The "Std" column lists the standard deviation calculated from multiple measurements of synonymous codons. This value is `nan` when only one codon was measured.
