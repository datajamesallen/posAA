Description
Amino acid scores for deep mutational scan of ubiquitin in a yeast display binding assay to E1 with excess E1. Region 2 (positions 68-76).
Abstract
This experiment used the same library of ubiquitin variants as previously described in Roscoe et al. 2013. The ubiquitin variants were displayed as C-terminal fusions with Aga2-HA and reacted with E1. Bound cells were isolated using FACS and deep sequencing was used to quantify enrichment or depletion of cells in the bound population.

This entry describes the second of two regions assayed with excess E1, covering ubiquitin positions 68-76.
Method
Scores were calculated using the EMPIRIC log ratios approach, using the ratio of E1-reactive cells to HA-displaying cells. Scores were normalized such that the average wild type synonymous variant was 1 and the average nonsense mutation was 0. The raw $log_2$ ratio is included as an extra column. The "Std" column lists the standard deviation calculated from multiple measurements of synonymous codons. This value is `nan` when only one codon was measured.
