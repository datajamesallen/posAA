Description
Deep mutational scan of all single mutants in a nine-amino acid region of Hsp90 (Hsp82) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under the control of the TEF promoter with CYC 3'UTR.
Abstract
This study measured the effects of yeast HSP90 variants under the control of different promoters to explore the relationship between protein sequence and expression level. The results showed that reduced expression level (compared to wild-type expression) revealed new partial loss of function mutations.
Method
Growth rates were calculated for each variant and converted into selection coefficients. The selection coefficient for each variant under control of this promoter/UTR combination is reported as the score. For variants with multiple synonymous codons, the reported coefficient is the average of all synonymous variant's selection coefficients.

Variants annotated as "null-like" have a score of -1.
