Description
Deep mutational scan of all single mutants in a nine-amino acid region of Hsp90 (Hsp82) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 36C without addition of NaCl.
Abstract
This study measured the effect of variants in yeast HSP90 under different combinations of temperature (30C or 36C) and presence/absence of salt (0.5 M NaCl). The results explore the adaptive potential of this essential gene.
Method
Sequencing reads were filtered based on a minimum Phred quality score of 20 across all 36 bases. For each time point, the log2 ratio of each variant's count to the wild type count was calculated. The score of each variant was calculated as the slope of these log ratios to time in wild type generations. Scores of -0.5 are considered null-like.
Organism
