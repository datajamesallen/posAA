Description
Nucleotide variant scores for deep mutational scan of the BRCA1 RING domain using yeast two-hybrid calculated by Enrich2.
Abstract
These experiments measured the functional consequences of mutations in the BRCA1 RING domain, where most clinically-relevant single nucleotide variants reside. One goal of the study was to create a "look-up table" of single nucleotide variants for clinical use, by prospectively measuring the impact of all possible variants that are likely to appear in patients. The study combines two different assays - one based on E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and one based on BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer formation - and makes one of the first attempts to combine data from different MAVEs on the same target.

This entry contains scores from the yeast two-hybrid assay, which tested the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer formation in BRCA1 variants.

Note that this score set does not describe the scores presented in the original publication. It is a reanalysis of the raw data that was produced as part of testing and development for Enrich2.
Method
Scores were calculated using the Enrich2 weighted least squares regression scoring model. Replicate scores were combined using the Enrich2 random-effects model. Counts for each variant were calculated as the sum of counts for all barcodes associated with that variant.

The scores and standard errors calculated for each of replicate appear as additional columns.

Count columns are named using the format `<replicate>_c_<timepoint>`. The 0 time point is the input (unselected). Time points are given in hours.
