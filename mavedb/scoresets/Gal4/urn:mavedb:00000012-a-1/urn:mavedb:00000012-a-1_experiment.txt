Description
Deep mutational scan of Gal4 DNA-binding domain using a yeast growth assay. 24 hours of nonselective growth.
Abstract
This experiment demonstrated the programmed allelic series (PALS) method for site-directed mutagenesis using microarrays. The impact of nearly all singleton missense mutation in the Gal4 yeast transcription factor was measured in multiple selections.
Method
Variant counts were calculated by summing the read counts of barcodes associated with each variant. The enrichment score for each variant is the $\log_2$ ratio of the mutant count over the wild type count for the selected time point minus the $\log_2$ ratio of the mutant count over the wild type count for the input time point (ratio of ratios).
Organism
Saccharomyces cerevisiae
