Description
Nucleotide variant scores for deep mutational scan of the hYAP65 WW domain using phage display calculated by Enrich2.
Abstract
This was the first published deep mutational scan. The experiment quantified binding affinity between the human YAP65 (YAP1) WW domain and a peptide binding partner using phage display. The phage display selection was tuned such that the enrichment in each round was moderate, allowing inefficient binders to be maintained in the population and subsequently quantified.

Note that this score set does not describe the scores presented in the original publication. It is a reanalysis of the raw data that was produced as part of testing and development for Enrich2.
Method
Scores were calculated using the Enrich2 weighted least squares regression scoring model. Scores for the two technical replicates were combined using the Enrich2 random-effects model.

The scores and standard errors calculated for each of the two technical replicates (101208 and 110307) appear as additional columns.

Count columns are named using the format `<replicate>_c_<timepoint>`. The 0 time point is the input (unselected) and each replicate underwent three rounds of selection, numbered 1..3.
