Description
Amino acid variant scores for deep mutational scan of the E4B U-box domain using phage display calculated by Enrich2.
Abstract
This study identified multiple gain-of-function mutations in the ubiquitination factor E4B U-box domain by measuring auto-ubiquitination in a phage display system. E4B is an E3 ligase, responsible for transferring a ubiquitin from an E2 ligase to the target (in this case the phage displaying E4B). Many of these mutations are not specific to one E2 enzyme and so may be generalizable for mutiple E2s and E3s.

Note that this score set does not describe the scores presented in the original publication. It is a reanalysis of the raw data that was produced as part of testing and development for Enrich2.
Method
Scores were calculated using the Enrich2 weighted least squares regression scoring model. Replicate scores were combined using the Enrich2 random-effects model. In contrast to the originally reported scores, these scores use all rounds of phage display instead of only the input/last round to calculate scores.

The scores and standard errors calculated for each of replicate appear as additional columns.

Count columns are named using the format `<replicate>_c_<timepoint>`. The 0 time point is the input (unselected). Time points are given in rounds.
